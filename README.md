SaveLangs is a personal passion project that merges full-stack development with the opportunity to dive deep into TypeScript and unit testing with Jest. The ultimate goal is to build a scalable platform that helps preserve endangered and minority languages, starting with Fanés — my own heritage dialect.

🌍 Project Overview

SaveLangs aims to create a digital space where speakers and enthusiasts of minority languages can come together to contribute and preserve their language. Through collaborative efforts, users can share words, phrases, and grammar, effectively building a living, digital dictionary.

Starting with Fanés, the goal is to provide a platform where communities can not only preserve their language but also share it with future generations. In the future, I plan to expand the platform to include other regional languages from across Italy and beyond.

🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using a combination of modern technologies:
	•	Fastify: For building the backend API — fast, lightweight, and highly performant.
	•	MongoDB: For data storage and persistence, enabling scalable storage of language resources.
	•	TypeScript: For safer, statically typed code that scales well as the project grows.
	•	Jest: For unit testing to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

🚀 Key Features

	•	Collaborative Contributions: Users can add new words, phrases, and grammatical information, allowing the dictionary to evolve over time.
	•	Scalability: Designed to scale with more languages and features in the future.
	•	Community Focus: A platform that empowers users to preserve their linguistic heritage and pass it on to others.

🧑‍💻 Skills Gained

	•	TypeScript: Gaining hands-on experience in writing scalable and type-safe applications.
	•	Unit Testing with Jest: Building a robust test suite to ensure quality code.
	•	API Development: Using Fastify to build efficient, RESTful APIs.
	•	MongoDB: Working with a NoSQL database to handle dynamic and scalable data.
